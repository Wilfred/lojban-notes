* Attitudinal Scope                                                  :medium:

Attitudinals apply to whatever the scope of the previous word is.

#+BEGIN_SRC 
lo melbi .ui gerku
I'm happy that it's *pretty* (and it happens to be a dog)

lo melbi gerku .ui
I'm happy that it's a dog (and it happens to be pretty)

lo .ui melbi gerku
I'm happy that it's a *pretty dog*
#+END_SRC

Look at the previous word, and see what it applies to. In the last
example, ~lo~ applies to all of ~melbi gerku~, so the ~ui~ applies to all of
~melbi gerku~ too.

Knowing this, you can understand this phrase:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
re verba cu .ui kelci 
I'm happy that two children are playing.
#+END_SRC

I'm not happy due to the ~cu~, I'm happy due to whatever the ~cu~
covers. In this case, that's the ~kelci~.
